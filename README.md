## Write-Up Guidelines

To keep a uniformity on the write-ups, use the following style guide:

* Discussion Title: {Machine} write-up by {username}
* Title each phase with an H2 tag (##)
* Title each step of a phase with an H3 tag(###)
* Enclose all commands and code in a code block (~~~)
* Use external links for used exploits
* Tag the post properly, eg. {machine},writeups,etc.
